Snow crab are an iconic species in the Bering Sea that support an economically important fishery and undergo extensive monitoring and management. However, since 2018 more than 10 billion snow crab have disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea and the population collapsed to historical lows in 2021 and 2022. We link this collapse to a marine heatwave in the eastern Bering Sea during 2018 and 2019. Calculated caloric requirements, reduced spatial distribution, and observed body condition suggests that starvation played a role in the collapse. Fisheries disaster funds were requested in 2022 after allowable catches in the fisheries were slashed by ~90% in 2021. The fishery was closed for the first time in 2022. The collapse of snow crab foreshadows climate-related fisheries management problems that will be more frequently faced around the globe. Losing a frame of reference for future ecosystems as environmental conditions move beyond historical observations shifts our management paradigm from predictive to reactive. New management paradigms will be needed to face this challenge. 


\newpage

Snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*) is one of the most abundant species in the benthic ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea and the population has supported an iconic fishery valued at over US$250 million that is the focus of "Deadliest Catch", a widely viewed reality television show. The implementation of quota-based fisheries management in 2005 has made the fishery less "deadly" (NPFMC, 2010) and fisheries management in Alaska is considered to be some of the most effective in the world (Hilborn et al., 2021). Snow crab are distributed widely over the Bering Sea shelf (\autoref{data_figure}a) and the National Marine Fisheries Service conducts yearly bottom trawl surveys monitor the size and number of crab on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. Many field and laboratory studies aimed at understanding population processes like growth and maturity have also been performed (e.g. Copeman et al., 2021). In spite of this attention and effort, the stock unexpectedly collapsed in 2021. 

The collapse in 2021 occurred three years after the observed abundance of snow crab was at historical highs (\autoref{data_figure}c). Groups of crab of similar sizes are called 'pseudocohorts' because true cohorts cannot be identified as a result of difficulties in ageing crab associated with the loss of the hard body parts during the molting process.  The largest pseudocohort on record was observed in the survey beginning in 2015 and unexpectedly declined by roughly half from 2018 to 2019 (\autoref{data_figure}d). The survey was cancelled in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 2021 survey found the fewest snow crab on the eastern Bering Sea shelf since the survey began in 1975. More than 10 billion crab disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea shelf from 2018 to 2021 (Szuwalski, 2021).

Hypotheses to explain the disappearance of these crab fall under two categories: either the crab are still alive but the survey did not see them or the crab have died. It is possible the crab are in the eastern Bering Sea, but were poorly sampled by the most recent surveys. If this were the case, one would expect estimates for other similar species like Tanner crab to have declined unexpectedly, but the population trend for Tanner crab increased (Figure S1). Movement to the northern Bering Sea could account for declines in the eastern Bering Sea, but surveys in the northern Bering Sea did not find crab in the quantities or of the correct sizes to explain declines in the south (\autoref{data_figure}a). Movement west into Russian waters is another possibility, but Russian scientists reported declines in catch per unit effort in 2020 (Chernienko, 2021), which one might not expect if crab from Alaska emigrated. Finally, it is possible that the crab moved into deeper waters on the Bering Sea slope. High fishery catch per unit effort in deeper waters during the 2021 fishery supports this possibility to some extent, but the amount of available habitat is less than 10% of that on the shelf (figures S2) and fishery catch per unit effort from 2022 was the lowest on record (figure S3). Consequently, it is unlikely that all of the missing crab from the shelf are on the slope. Given these observations, mortality is a likely culprit for the bulk of the collapse.

Mortality could be affected via several pathways. Snow crab are generally cold-water loving, but they can function in waters up to 12 degrees C in the laboratory (Foyle et al., 1989). An intense marine heatwave occurred in the Bering Sea during 2018 and 2019 and the 'cold pool' (a mass of water <2 degrees C on the sea floor with which juvenile snow crab are associated) was absent during this period (\autoref{data_figure}b). While not fatal, the resulting bottom temperatures could affect metabolic costs and alter intra- and inter-specific interactions. Smaller crab are a main component of the diet of Pacific cod in the Bering Sea (Lang and Livingston, 1996) and recent changes in the distribution and abundance of cod and crab have resulted in increased consumption of crab by cod. Removals by the snow crab fishery and incidental mortality in fisheries for other species in the Bering Sea may also impact the population dynamics of snow crab. Larger snow crab are known to consume smaller snow crab and cannibalism has been suggested as an important driver of population dynamics in eastern Canadian populations (Lovrich et al., 1997). Finally, bitter crab syndrome, a fatal disease resulting from infection by a dinoflagellate (Meyers et al. 1996), has been observed more frequently in the survey in the last several years and is generally associated with warmer conditions and high densities of immature crab. 

To understand the recent collapse, we first attempt to understand the historical variability in mortality. We fit a population dynamics model to the abundance and size composition data for male crab and estimated recruitment (small crab entering the population) and a maturity- and year-specific total mortality. 'Total mortality' represents the fraction of crab dying in a given year due to any cause. We then collated maturity-specific time series of potential stressors from 1991 to 2019 and used them in generalized additive models (GAMs; Wood, 2011) to predict total mortality estimated from the population dynamics models (see SI for detailed methodology, sensitivities, and simulation testing).

The population dynamics model fit the indices of abundance and size composition data from the survey well, which is not unexpected, given the flexibility of the model (\autoref{fits_figure}a & b). Estimated mortality was higher and more varied for mature crab than for immature crab and estimated mortalities in 2018 and 2019 were the some of the highest for both immature and mature crab in the time series. We simulated snow crab populations with time-variation in mortality to understand the ability of our population dynamics model to estimate these quantities with the available data. The correlation between estimated mortality and simulated mortality were high which suggests that analyses relating estimates of mortality and environmental covariates are justifiable (see SI for details). GAMs fit to estimated immature and mature mortality explained ~72% and ~66% of the variability, respectively (\autoref{fits_figure}c). Higher temperatures and higher densities of mature crab were significantly associated with higher mortality for both immature and mature crab. These relationships were robust to leave-one-out cross validation and the deviance explained was 'significant' under randomization trials (see SI). Importantly, our results do not support a strong connection between snow crab mortality and indices of trawling, cannibalism, disease, or predation. All of these forces must contribute to underlying mortality, but estimated variability in historical mortality at the population level was only significantly related to temperature and mature population size. 

Assessing the predictive skill of a model is an important check on over-fitting and is relevant to providing management advice. After an ecologically damaging and economically costly collapse, it is natural to ask if we could have foreseen the collapse. To explore this question, we excluded 1, 2, and 3 years of data from the end of the time series, refit the models, then tried to predict the excluded years of mortality with the covariates from those years. The model for immature mortality contained enough information in 2016 to forecast an increase in mortality, but it was never able to reach the magnitude of the estimated mortality in 2019 (\autoref{fits_figure}c). The model for mature mortality performed similarly, forecasting an increase in mortality over the projection period, but it was not able to reach the estimated mortalities until the most recent data was in the model. This suggests that the circumstances underpinning the recent collapse were unprecedented in the Bering Sea in recent history.

The collapse of eastern Bering Sea snow crab appears to be one of the largest reported losses of motile marine macrofauna to marine heatwaves globally (Smith et al., 2023), exacerbated by the record number of snow crab in the system. However, the thermal limits of snow crab far exceed the observed temperatures (Foyle et al., 1998). Temperature-dependent caloric requirements are a potential explanation to relate temperature to mortality. Foyle et al. (1989) showed the caloric requirements for snow crab in the lab nearly double from 0 degrees to 3 degrees C, which is roughly the change experienced by immature crab from 2017 to 2018 (\autoref{temp_fig}a). Extrapolating the caloric requirements based on temperature occupied, abundance of crab at size, and weight at size suggests that the caloric requirements for the modeled fraction of snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea during 2018 quadrupled from 2017 and were double the previous maximum value in 1998 (\autoref{temp_fig}b). The impact of increased caloric demands appears to be reflected in the observed weight at size. A 75 mm carapace width crab in 2018 weighed on average 156 grams and was ~25 grams lighter (~15% of its bodyweight) than a crab in 2017 of the same size in the same temperature waters (\autoref{temp_fig}c). Furthermore, the spatial footprint of the stock was near the lowest levels historically in 2018 (\autoref{temp_fig}d & e). The unprecedented caloric demands coupled with a small area from which to forage relative to historical grounds suggests starvation likely played a role in the disappearance of more than 10 billion snow crab, similar to the marine-heatwave related collapse of Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska in 2016 (Barbeaux et al., 2020). Importantly, oxygen demand does not appear to be the limiting criteria as snow crab can meet routine oxygen demand even at lethal temperatures of 18 degrees C (Foyle et al., 1989). It is also possible that the significance of mature population size in our models reflects some aspect of cannibalism not captured by our indices as a result of movement of animals throughout the year.

The eastern Bering Sea snow crab population collapsed once before in the late 1990s, but that collapse arose from a lack of recruitment, not a sudden mortality event. The Arctic Oscillation and sea ice have been linked to snow crab recruitment and projections of recruitment suggest snow crab abundances will decline in the future as sea ice disappears from the eastern Bering Sea (Szuwalski et al., 2021). However, these declines were projected to occur at least twenty years from now. Given the recent collapse, the short-term future of snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea is precariously uncertain. Over the long-term, the northern Bering Sea is a prospective climate refugia for snow crab (and potentially a fishery; Fedewa et al., 2020), but the possibility of a fishery rests on the uncertain probability of crab growing to a larger size in the north and the currents retaining pelagic larvae released in the northern Bering Sea.

In 2021, 59 boats fished for snow crab which brought $219 million (ex-vessel) into fishing communities (Garber-Yonts, 2022). The disappearance of snow crab will be a staggering blow to the functioning of some communities in rural Alaska like those on Saint Paul Island, which relies strongly on the revenue derived from the capture and processing of snow crab. The Magnuson-Stevens Act includes provisions for fisheries disaster assistance which were designed to provide economic support for communities facing hardship as a result of collapsed fisheries. The number of applications in the United States has been increasing in recent years (Bellquist et al., 2021) and an application for snow crab was received in early 2022. These funds are a boon in the medium-term, but years can pass between disaster to dispersal of these funds. Consequently, Alaska crabbers face an uncertain short-term future as the disaster funds may not arrive in time to forestall the bankruptcy of long-standing businesses.

Beyond the fishery for snow crab, Alaskan fisheries are some of the most productive in the world, producing 5.27 billion tons of seafood in 2021 valued at $1.9 billion (NOAA, 2022). When snow crab numbers declined in 1999, Bering Sea walleye pollock numbers (which supports the largest fishery in the Bering Sea and one of the largest in the world, FAO, 2022) also declined shortly after (\autoref{ebs_abund}). This relationship is captured by the significant positive correlation between the time series of pollock and snow crab abundance at a lag of 1 year (\autoref{ebs_abund}d). While this correlation is suggestive, it is ultimately uncertain how the massive loss of crab will affect the benthic ecosystem and the fisheries dependent upon it. However, it is virtually certain that the benthic community in the eastern Bering Sea during the not-too-distant future will look different than today's given the rapid pace of warming (Rantanen et al., 2022).  

Overfishing has historically been the largest threat to global fisheries, but, in many parts of the world, this problem has been solved (Hilborn et al., 2022). Climate change is the next existential crisis for fisheries, and snow crab is a prime example for how quickly the outlook can change for a population. In 2018, catches were projected to increase to levels not seen in decades. Three years later, the population had collapsed. Our current management tools base projected sustainable yields on the historical dynamics of a population. However, projections based on historical dynamics are not reliable when the future of a region will not resemble the past. Beyond reconsidering how sustainable catches are calculated, the practical matters of efficient disaster response, implementing management institutions that allow fishers to pursue diverse portfolios of species, ensuring consistent and timely biological surveys, and support for the development of alternative marine-based livelihoods (e.g. mariculture) need close attention from management and stakeholders. The Bering Sea is on the front lines of climate-driven ecosystem change and the problems currently faced in the Bering Sea foreshadow the problems that will need to be confronted globally.
