# snow_down
This repository holds the code to produce the analyses in 'The collapse of the eastern Bering Sea snow crab". Code for some figures in the supplementary materials is not included here, but can be made available upon request. Output associated with the 'simulation' and 'sensitivities' directories used to produce figures in the supplementary materials are not stored in this repo, but can be produced by running the scripts in those directories.
